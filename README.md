# DBMSProject
The Library Management System is a relational database project that manages book inventories, memberships, staff operations, and transactions like issuing and returning books. It mirrors real-world libraries using normalized tables, foreign keys, and structured SQL for accurate, secure, and efficient operations.

# Website
The website is not a working model of the project. It is just to showcase the demo of the existing data stored in the database.
